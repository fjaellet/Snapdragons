# snapdragons (Barcelona flavour)

Snapdragons is a population synthesis &amp; mock survey data generation code - it creates synthetic stars from an N-body simulation of a galaxy. 
Please cite the Snapdragons paper ([Hunt et al. 2015, MNRAS, 450, 2132](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.2132H)) if you use it for publication.

This version is used in some of the hands-on session for the [Gaia-COST school in Barcelona ](https://github.com/Santiastro1/Gaia_School_BCN). It differs only in some superficial respects from the [original code](https://github.com/JASHunt/Snapdragons). Main contributors of this version (apart from [Jason Hunt](https://github.com/JASHunt)) are [Santi Roca](https://github.com/Santiastro1) and [Merc√© Romero](https://github.com/mromerog). 

## How does this work?

It's that simple: From the input: 
* N-body model (with positions, masses, ages, and metallicities) 
* isochrone tables
* (2D/3D) extinction model
* initial mass function
* limiting magnitude
* Gaia error model
snapdragons creates the output: 
* Synthetic stellar data

The code is in written in fortran. It has a Makefile in the main directory, which compiles the source code in src. To compile just type 'make' in the main directory.
The main module is called src/PopSynth.F, several options can be specified in Mockinioptions.h

You must dowload the extinction maps separately from https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnMgd4KLTt9j6HtlSWaRd9kP5Rem?e=QcCqax and place them in the ini folder (not inside UBV)

## Changing input parameters

### Input simulation

The input file needs to be an ascii table with the following structure:
    * x, y, z(kpc), vx, vy, vz(km/s), metallicity(z), age(Gyr), mass(solar) [, other columns]
The name of the input file is hidden in PopSynth.F - so it might be easiest to replace the default input file (ini/input.dat) manually/using a python wrapper program.

### Input parameters

Mockinioptions.h lets you choose some basic things: 
* magnitude limit (in the V band): ChosenLim=14.0d0 
* whether to convolve the results with the Gaia error model: error=1  
* whether to output an ascii or a binary file: Binary=0

Don't forget to recompile before rerunning.

## Output

The default snapdragons output is stored in output/ as ascii or binary file without header.. There is, however, a python script in py/ that will convert this output to standard FITS file in the same directory:
    
    ``cd py``
    ``python snapdragons2fits.py``

Output columns in the ascii/binary version are: 

* 1 true ra
